#Welcome;Welcome to the HCA Tonsil Data Atlas instance for the CD4+ T cells!
#ReducedDimensionPlot1;We identified fourteen clusters... 
#ReducedDimensionPlot1_ColorBy;You can see that they are colored in the UMAP according to their annotated cell type
#RowDataTable1;From this table, you can select any gene, using the search widget (case sensitive, so make sure you type the correct name). This information can be propagated to other panels...
#FeatureAssayPlot1;... like this Feature Assay Plot, where the expression of a feature (a gene here) is plotted against any covariate of interest. In this case, the gene BACH2 is pre-selected. In the violin plot representations, the sparsity does not help too much in seeing which cluster this gene is more consistently expressed - to do that we go back to the UMAP plot...
#ReducedDimensionPlot1;This is still colored by the annotated cluster for the cell types.
#ReducedDimensionPlot1_ColorBy;We change the value to plot the individual dots to Feature Name, and the continuous scale of the expression values for the gene are displayed...
#ReducedDimensionPlot1;... on the main UMAP plot, nicely highlighting how BACH2 is expressed mainly in Naive cells 
#ComplexHeatmapPlot1;A more comprehensive collection of markers for all the identified cell types is reported in this heatmap
#FeatureAssayPlot2;IL7R is more expressed in central memory T cells. Interestingly, TCF7 can be used to discriminate two different subpopulations...
#FeatureAssayPlot2_YAxisFeatureName + .selectize-control;Change the value of the displayed expression information to TCF7 ...
#FeatureAssayPlot2;see how the plot changes in the plot widget of the panel
#ColumnDataPlot1;Here is a summary of the different annotated cell types, with a visual representation of an abundance table. We will focus on the pre-selected group of 3 clusters on Treg cells
#ReducedDimensionPlot2;See how the expression of IL2RA is nicely shown in the effector T-regs - the selected cells from the column data plot introduce some transparency to highlight the subset of interest
#ReducedDimensionPlot2_ColumnSelectionSource + .selectize-control;This is controlled by the widget in the Selection parameters
#ComplexHeatmapPlot2;This heatmap displays the signature for the different subtypes of Treg cells. The displayed features can be updated in the "Edit feature names" functionality in the Data Parameters
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the tour on the CD4+ T cells subset of the Tonsil Data Atlas! Enjoy the exploration with <code>iSEE</code>!
